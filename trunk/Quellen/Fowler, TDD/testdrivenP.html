<blockquote>
<b>Summary</b><br>
Martin Fowler, chief scientist at Thoughtworks, Inc. and author of numerous 
books on software design and process, talks with Bill Venners about 
the unhurried quality of test-first design and monological
thinking, and the difference between unit and functional testing.
</blockquote>

<p>
Over the last decade, Martin Fowler pioneered many software development 
techniques in the development of business information systems. He's well known 
for his work on object-oriented analysis and design, software patterns, Unified 
Modeling Language, agile software processes (particularly extreme programming), 
and refactoring. He is the author of <em>Analysis Patterns</em> (Oct. 1996), 
<em>Refactoring</em> (June 1999; coauthored with Kent Beck, et al.), <em>UML 
Distilled</em> (Aug. 1999; with Kendall Scott), <em>Planning Extreme 
Programming</em> (Oct. 2000; with Kent Beck), and the soon to be released 
<em>Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture</em> (Nov. 2002), all 
published by Addison Wesley.

</p><p>In this six-part interview, which is being published in weekly installments, 
Fowler gives his views on many topics, including refactoring, design, testing, 
and extreme programming. In <a href="http://www.artima.com/intv/refactor.html">Part I</a>, Fowler makes 
the business case for refactoring and testing, and describes the interplay 
between refactoring, design, and reliability. In <a href="http://www.artima.com/intv/principles.html">Part 
II</a>, Fowler discusses design principles of avoiding duplication, separating 
presentation and domain logic, being explicit, and describes how refactoring
depends on code ownership. In <a href="http://www.artima.com/intv/evolution.html">Part III</a>, Fowler 
differentiates between planned and evolutionary design, suggests that focusing 
on superficial problems can lead to the discovery of substantial problems, and 
claims that doing a good job won't slow you down. In <a href="http://www.artima.com/intv/flexplex.html">Part IV</a>, 
Fowler discusses design decay, flexibility and reusability versus complexity,
four criteria for a simple system, and interface design. In this fifth installment, 
Fowler describes the unhurried quality of test-first design, defines monological
thinking, and distinguishes between unit and functional testing.


</p><h1>Designing in Small Steps</h1>

<p>
<strong>Bill Venners</strong>: When doing evolutionary design, are you designing 
interfaces in small steps, one piece of the interface at a time?

</p><p>
<strong>Martin Fowler</strong>: Yes. If I'm creating a <code>Money</code> class, I'll 
make <code>plus</code> work first before I even think about the interface of 
<code>multiply</code>. Just get <code>plus</code> to work. Don't think about anything 
else, just focus on <code>plus</code>. Come up with its interface. Come up with its 
implementation. Now we've done <code>plus</code>. Now let's do the next bit.

</p><p>
<strong>Bill Venners</strong>: I'm more comfortable with, OK I've got a 
<code>Money</code> class, what are its responsibilities? What services does it need to 
provide? Define the interfaces without implementing the code, and get that nice and easy 
to understand. And then you can write code, test, implement, test, implement. But I still 
tend to think more of partitioning the whole system into subsystems, and sub-subsystems, 
and designing interfaces in the chunks they'll be used, like classes.

</p><p>
<strong>Martin Fowler</strong>: The thing I like about taking small steps and writing 
tests first is that it gives me a simple to do list of the things I've got to do. At each end 
point I have a certain amount of closure. I say, OK, this stuff works. Check it in. It's all 
there. It does what it does and it does it correctly.


</p><h1>A Sense of Unhurriedness</h1>

<p>
<strong>Martin Fowler</strong>: There's an impossible-to-express quality about test-first
design that gives you a sense of unhurriedness. You are actually moving very 
quickly, but there's an unhurriedness because you are creating little micro-goals for 
yourself and satisfying them. At each point you know you are doing one micro-goal piece 
of work, and it's done when the test passes. That is a very calming thing. It reduces the 
scope of what you have to think about. You don't have to think about everything you 
have to do in the class. You just have to think about one little piece of responsibility. You 
make that work and then you refactor it so everything is very nicely designed. Then you 
add in the next piece of responsibility. I previously used the kind of approach you 
describe. I'd ask, "What's the interface of this?" I've now switched and I much more 
prefer incremental design.

</p><p>
<strong>Bill Venners</strong>: Well, I'll try it.

</p><p>
<strong>Martin Fowler</strong>: In many ways, you have to just try the process out for 
a little while. It's best to try it out with someone who's done it before. Just do it.

</p><p>
Here's an example of incremental design that I ran into when writing <em>Patterns of 
Enterprise Applications Architecture Design</em>. I needed to create an example in a 
pattern about associative table mappings. If you have a many-to-many relationship in 
memory and you need to persist that to a relational database, it requires an extra link 
table, so you get three tables. There are multiple ways to pull that data back into memory 
from the database. There is a simplistic way of pulling the data back that requires a lot of 
select statements to be executed. There is also a faster way to pull it back. You can just 
pull the data back in a single select statement. But then it's a bit more awkward to get the 
data out and to unpack it into the various objects.

</p><p>
I created the example for that pattern using incremental design. I started by writing an 
example that was hard-coded for three particular tables and two particular classes. I didn't 
think about generalizing it. I just made a very specific, concrete example work. After I 
got that working and had it passing its tests, I started refactoring the example to make it 
more generally applicable. After a bit of time refactoring, I had a general mechanism. All 
I had to do was write a tiny mapping class, and I could make the example work with any 
tables and classes. I had a general purpose structure.

</p><p>
I found it much easier to do the concrete example first, then refactor that to the abstract 
example, than to come up with the abstract example first and then apply that to the 
concrete case. I also found it much more calm and unhurried, even though the process 
went pretty swiftly. I constantly knew where I was and where I was going. I felt much 
more in control of the situation. I didn't have that, "Am I ever going to make this code 
work?" feeling.


</p><h1>Monological Thinking</h1>

<p>
<strong>Martin Fowler</strong>: A phrase I've coined for Kent's new book is 
<em>monological thinking</em>. By monological, I mean using one style of thought, 
one style of logic, at any one time. When I was creating the specific example, I was just 
thinking about how to make a very concrete example work. When I moved into a 
refactoring mode, I was thinking about how to abstract the working concrete example. I 
wasn't thinking about how to make the example work and how to make an abstract 
solution at the same time. I made it work, then I abstracted it. I felt it went quicker and 
was a much more calm and pleasurable experience.

</p><p>
<strong>Bill Venners</strong>: It sounds like incremental design is a way of dealing 
with complexity given our limited brains. To what extent do you think whether you write 
tests first or second is a personality choice? Are some people by their nature more suited 
to this style of dealing with complexity versus another?

</p><p>
<strong>Martin Fowler</strong>: That may well be true. It could well be that there are 
personality differences. However, I think it is hard to tell at the moment because not 
enough people have tried the test-driven development approach. Test-driven development 
is common in the extreme programming community, but that's still a very small slice of 
the programming population.

</p><p>
I recommend you sit down with somebody whose done test-driven development, so that 
you do it pairing with somebody who knows that style. I think you'd get a much better 
appreciation of how it works that way, because it is so very counter-intuitive. 
Unfortunately we won't have time to do something like that, but I'd love to do that with 
you. I can almost guarantee that you'll say, "What we're going to take that small of a 
step? It's not worth going such a small step." And I'll say, "Just trust me. Do these tiny 
steps." I've seen it so many times. I remember watching someone pair program with Kent 
for the first time. This guy had read up on XP and was pretty much in favor of it. He was 
very positive about XP already. There were times when his jaw was dropping at the tiny 
little moves Kent was making. He came out of it realizing that there is a whole style to 
test-driven development that he didn't expect.


</p><h1>Unit Testing</h1>

<p>
<strong>Bill Venners</strong>: What is the unit in unit test? Define unit test.

</p><p>
<strong>Martin Fowler</strong>: That's very difficult. To a first approximation, it's a 
class. But as you work with unit tests more, you begin to realize you're testing little areas 
of responsibility, and that could be a part of a class or it could be several classes together. 
I don't get too hung up about it, but I'd say if you're just starting out, think of unit tests as 
just writing a test case per class.

</p><p>
<strong>Bill Venners</strong>: And the reason you call it "unit" testing is that you're
testing individual pieces that make up the program. To get a robust whole, you build it on 
robust parts, or robust units. To get the parts robust, you test them individually with unit 
tests.

</p><p>
<strong>Martin Fowler</strong>: That's the notion of where unit testing originally came 
from. Unit testing in XP is often unlike classical unit testing, because in XP you're 
usually not testing each unit in isolation. You're testing each class and its immediate 
connections to its neighbors.

</p><p>
<strong>Bill Venners</strong>: What's the difference between unit and functional 
testing?

</p><p>
<strong>Martin Fowler</strong>: The current name in XP circles for functional tests is 
acceptance tests. Acceptance tests view the system more as a black box and test more end 
to end across the whole system. You would have unit tests for individual classes in the 
domain and database mapping layers. In most of these unit tests, you might not even 
connect the database. You would stub the database out. But with the functional tests, 
which go end to end, you would want everything connected.

</p><p>
<strong>Bill Venners</strong>: When do you stop writing tests? You say in 
<em>Refactoring</em>, "There's a point of diminishing returns with testing, and there's 
a danger that by writing too many tests you become discouraged and end up not writing 
any. You should concentrate on where the risk is." How do you know where the risk is?

</p><p>
<strong>Martin Fowler</strong>: Ask yourself which bits of the program would you be 
scared to change? One test I've come up with since the <em>Refactoring</em> book is 
asking if there is any line of code that you could comment out and the tests wouldn't fail? 
If so, you are either missing a test or you've got an unnecessary line of code. Similarly, 
take any Boolean expression. Could you just reverse it? What test would fail? If there's 
not a test failing, then, you've obviously got some more tests to write or some code to 
remove.

</p><p>
<strong>Bill Venners</strong>: Sounds like you could actually automate that.

</p><p>
<strong>Martin Fowler</strong>: Actually, there is a program that does that. It's called 
JesTer. The problem is it takes a long time to run, because every time it makes one minor 
mutation it has to run the entire build test suite.
