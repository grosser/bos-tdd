# Test::Unit To RSpec convertor 
A Rails Plugin by David Rice

This plugin is an attempt at easing the conversion processes between the Test::Unit and RSpec frameworks for Rails testing. It's not in anyway guaranteed to get your test cases passing with RSpec without a bit of love and attention. It adds the following rake task;

  rake convert_to_rspec

## Quick Notes

* Make sure you backup first before running
* Note: No changes are actually made to the test/ directory files
* Unit, Functional and Helper (if in their default locations will be found and converted)
* Spec files will all be generated in the spec/ directory 
* If it doesn't work entirely for you why not think about adding to it, there's tests!
